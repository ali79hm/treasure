mix, touch, combine,... some different material with different temperature.
## what will happen to their temperature? to their physical phase?

here we have some heat transfer models:

### Water and Ice

when you have $m$ grams of water in $\theta_w\$ and  $n$ grams of ice in $\theta_i\$ and mix them in a insulated space

$y=x^2$

$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

$e^x=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}x^i$

$\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} = {n \choose k}$

$A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}$
