mix, touch, combine,... some different material with different temperature.
## what will happen to their temperature? to their physical phase?

here we have some heat transfer models:

### Water and Ice

       

```math
2x = x^{3x +4}
```
this is inline integral test
```math
\int_{a}^{b}
 ```
 and finish test
